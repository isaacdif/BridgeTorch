# BridgeTorch
The bridge and torch puzzle summarized here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_and_torch_problem

## BridgeTorchAlgorithm.java
This program applies the classic algorithm to an increasing number of people and outputs results to text file for analyzing how results vary with increasing N.

## BridgeTorchGame.java
This program runs the classic algorithim for the specified number of people and leaves the task of beating the algorithm up to the user.

## BridgeTorchObvious.java
This program runs the "obvious" solution. That is, it has the fastest person do all of the travelling, which is what most people think of when first presented with the problem.
